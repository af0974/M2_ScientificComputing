The interest of this problem is both fundamental and practical: fundamental because the secular variation reflects dynamical processes occurring inside the fluid outer core of the Earth, where the primary source of the geomagnetic field is located (the geodynamo). Practical because the knowledge of the secular variation (SV) can be used to forecast the evolution of the geomagnetic field in the near future (by means of a simple linear extrapolation).\n",
